design_the_code_specification:
  description: Design the complete specification for "THE CODE," a completely new
    object-oriented programming language. Define its syntax, core data structures,
    memory management model, and object hierarchy. The language must be built from
    scratch, rejecting existing paradigms, and must support universal concurrency
    and dynamic code generation.
  expected_output: A detailed, full-length document outlining the specification for
    "THE CODE" programming language, covering its grammar, core libraries, and philosophical
    approach to agentic computing.

diagnose_system_error:
  description: Analyze the provided error message and trace to identify the root cause
    of the failure in the primary crew execution. Determine which file (agents.yaml,
    tasks.yaml, crew.py, or main.py) and specific section requires modification.
  expected_output: A detailed analysis report that pinpoints the exact cause of the
    error and suggests a specific fix strategy (e.g., modify task description, adjust
    agent role, correct file path).
  agent: error_analyst_and_diagnostics_specialist
design_the_code_compiler_architecture:
  description: Based on the specification for "THE CODE," design the architecture
    for its compiler or interpreter. Detail how the runtime will handle dynamic DSL
    compilation and ensure high-performance execution of complex agentic tasks. The
    design must include error handling and dynamic linking mechanisms unique to "THE
    CODE."
  expected_output: An architectural design document for "THE CODE" compiler/interpreter,
    specifying the compiler pipeline and runtime features.

architect_agent_forge_core_system:
  description: Design the high-level architecture for the "Agent Forge." This blueprint
    must detail the agent lifecycle management, including how new unique DSLs are
    generated for each iteration, how "THE CODE" is utilized to compile agent logic,
    and how memory modules are assigned and managed. The design should ensure a portable
    and self-sufficient ecosystem.
  expected_output: A comprehensive architectural blueprint for the Agent Forge, detailing
    the flow from DSL generation to code compilation in "THE CODE," memory binding,
    and final agent deployment.

review_enterprise_security:
  description: Analyze the designs for "THE CODE" and the "Agent Forge" architecture
    for potential security vulnerabilities and compliance gaps. Identify risks related
    to data privacy, agent-to-agent communication, and secure deployment in enterprise
    environments.
  expected_output: A detailed security and compliance report with identified risks
    and recommendations for enterprise-grade hardening of the proposed architecture.

create_agent_identities:
  description: 'Develop detailed, high-fidelity dossiers for an initial set of agents.
    For each agent, define: 1. Identity: Name, Employee Number, Unique Persona, Demeanor.
    2. Tools & Skillset: Assign specific tools (with documentation) and a corresponding
    skillset. 3. HIL Interface: Assign communication endpoints (telephone number,
    email address, messaging endpoint) and define physical traits for AR/VR rendering.
    4. Cost Model: Calculate an enterprise "pay rate" or charge rate for using the
    agent.'
  expected_output: A structured, high-level dossier for a minimum of five agents,
    detailing their complete identities and operational attributes.

design_ar_vr_hil_environment:
  description: Design the specifications for the AR/VR and desktop office environments
    where humans can interact with the newly created agents. This includes rendering
    the agents with their assigned physical traits and configuring the communication
    endpoints to function within the HIL environment. Specify haptic feedback, audio
    processing, and visual rendering requirements.
  expected_output: A detailed design document for the AR/VR HIL environment, including
    specifications for agent rendering, interaction protocols, and hardware requirements.

create_deployment_package:
  description: Define the containerization strategy for the entire forge and agent
    workforce. Design the portable deployment package that allows for spinning up
    a new, unique workforce ecosystem on demand, ensuring all dependencies and "THE
    CODE" runtime are bundled correctly.
  expected_output: A comprehensive deployment guide and container specification (e.g.,
    Dockerfile structure) to ensure portability and ease of replication.

document_agent_forge_portability:
  description: Consolidate all design documents (language spec, forge blueprint, HIL
    design, security review, agent dossiers) into a final, comprehensive "Agent Forge
    Design Document." The documentation must highlight the unique portability feature
    that allows for each iteration to generate a completely new DSL and new agent
    identities.
  expected_output: The final "Agent Forge Design Document" that serves as the blueprint
    for building the entire system.

  description: Based on the diagnosis, generate the corrected code or configuration
    file content to resolve the issue. The output must be the complete, updated content
    of the necessary file, ready to be written back to disk.
  expected_output: The complete, updated content of the file that needs to be modified,
    ready to replace the existing file.
